            <h2>Schooling at Spring Dale Senior School</h2>
            <p>
                During my early life, I attended Spring Dale Senior School. I was part of a joint family, which was a wonderful experience. I was known for being a sharp-minded kid in school, actively participating in mathematics and science Olympiads. Moreover, I also enjoyed participating in fancy dress competitions, which were a lot of fun.

            <h2>Curiosity about Space and Astronomy</h2>
            <p>
                From a young age, I had a deep curiosity about space and astronomy. I loved stargazing and learning about the stars, planets, and the universe. This fascination with space eventually led me to explore more about the field of astrology.
