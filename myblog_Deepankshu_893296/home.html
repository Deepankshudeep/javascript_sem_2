            <h2>My Education</h2>
            <h4>Bachelors in Technology.</h4>
            <p>I did my engineering in Electronics and Communication engineering from Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, India. Personally, for me, it was a very good experience. I made new friends, learned a lot of things (Education and personality-wise). It was a 4-year course. I started in 2018 and finished in 2022.</p>
            <h4>Post Graduation in Full Stack Software Development</h4>
            <p>After my undergrad, I decided to pursue my higher education from a foreign college, hence I decided to go with Lambton College in Canada. Here I am learning advanced coursework. Software Engineering is my passion, and I am highly motivated to learn new things and develop my interpersonal skills as well. Here one can see diverse culture; therefore, one can learn about new cultures of people of different nations.</p>

            <h2>My Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Watching Movies</li>
                <p>Watching movies is one thing which I have always enjoyed as a kid. You know what, it's actually kinda hard for me to pick my all-time favorite movie because there are too many. Apart from movies, I like watching series also. My best series of all time, let's say 'The Mandalorian, Star Wars'. I am a huge fan of Star Wars and Grogu, made my life even better.</p>
                <li>Listening Music</li>
                <p>Listening to music is my escape from reality. I can go hours and hours listening to music.</p>
                <li>Working out</li>
                <p>Working out is yet one thing which I like doing the most. Not only physically but from a mental point of view. It's one of the best things a person can do.</p>
                <li>Gardening</li>
                <p>I remember doing gardening with my mother in my home country, and it was one thing I cherish the most. Then I moved to Canada and I had the chance to do it with my elder brother in his backyard. Oh! I remember it was hard at first, but the outcome, that is the beautiful Hydrangea and lilies, made the hard work pay.</p>
